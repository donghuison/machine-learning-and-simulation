u:  Velocity (2d vector)
p:  Pressure
f:  Forcing (here =0)
ν:  Kinematic Viscosity

* Velocity and pressure have zero initial condition.
* Homogeneous Dirichlet Boundary Conditions everywhere except for horizontal
  velocity at top. It is driven by an external flow.

-----

Solution strategy:   (Projection Method: Chorin's Splitting)

1. Solve Momentum equation without pressure gradient for tentative velocity
   (with given Boundary Conditions)

    ∂u/∂t + (u ⋅ ∇) u = ν ∇²u

2. Solve pressure poisson equation for pressure at next point in time
   (with homogeneous Neumann Boundary Conditions everywhere except for
   the top, where it is homogeneous Dirichlet)

    ∇²p = ρ/Δt ∇ ⋅ u           

3. Correct the velocities (and again enforce the Velocity Boundary Conditions)

    u ← u − Δt/ρ ∇ p

    Expected Outcome: After some time a swirling motion will take place

Strategy in index notation

u = [u, v]
x = [x, y]

1. Solve tentative velocity + velocity BC

    ∂u/∂t + u ∂u/∂x + v ∂u/∂y = ν ∂²u/∂x² + ν ∂²u/∂y²

    ∂v/∂t + u ∂v/∂x + v ∂v/∂y = ν ∂²v/∂x² + ν ∂²v/∂y²

2. Solve pressure poisson + pressure BC

    ∂²p/∂x² + ∂²p/∂y² = ρ/Δt (∂u/∂x + ∂v/∂y)

3. Correct velocity + velocity BC

    u ← u − Δt/ρ ∂p/∂x

    v ← v − Δt/ρ ∂p/∂y

IMPORTANT: Take care to select a timestep that ensures stability
